# phabricator-interpeller

Phabricator application for displaying the dependency graph between Maniphest tasks.

## Synopsis

Application is created as a new libph library which can be used as an extension for Phabricator (www.phabricator.org).
All codes are already liberated through Arcanist so everything necessary for instant usage with Phabricator.

## Installation

Put all codes next to Phabricator main directory (where arcanist, libphutil and phabricator itself are stored)
and add following configuration to Phabricator:

	./phabricator/bin/config set load-libraries '{ "phabricator-interpeller": "..\/phabricator-interpeller\/src" }'

## Application

In src/ folder you can find two applications prepared:

**Kanban** which adds one application icon between the user profile icon and quick creation icon and allows quick
access first dashboard mainly used as Kanban for the whole project.

**Interpeller** which allows to display graph of all dependencies between opened Maniphest tasks.

Feel free to remove which one you don't want to install in Phabricator.

## Extra attributes

Interpeller uses two custom attributes:

	is4u:estimated-hours
	is4u:progress

both integers; we use them for planning (how many hours is planned for the task and its progress as a percentage).

You can add these custom fields to Maniphest through Phabricator configuration or comment out these lines.

## D3 Library and Apache configuration

Dependency graph is displayed according to D3 Force package from www.d3js.org.
		
You have to include this JavaScript library into your web space - I did it through Apache httpd.conf configuration
through two different settings:

	Alias /ours-js/d3.v3.min.js /export/phabricator/phabricator-interpeller/src/interpeller/js/d3.v3.min.js

	RewriteRule ^/ours-js/(.*)      -       [L,QSA]

First one defines internal alias (we use /ours-js folder) for full path to installed JavaScript library. Second one
only excludes the whole folder /ours-js from all rewriting of Phabricator web space. You can run Phabricator on HTTP
or HTTPS protocol, there is no difference (internal links goes to `//hostname`).

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to Mike Bostock for excellent D3js library and the whole Phabricator team for such a great tool for organizing development.
